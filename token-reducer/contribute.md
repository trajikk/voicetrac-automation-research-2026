# Contributing to Token Reducer

Thanks for your interest in improving **Token Reducer**.

This project is open to contributions from anyone interested.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs with reproducible steps
- Suggest new features or improvements
- Improve docs and examples
- Fix issues and submit pull requests
- Add tests and performance validations

## Before You Start

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open an issue for significant changes and describe your approach.
3. Keep changes focused and minimal per pull request.

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madhan230205/token-reducer.git
cd token-reducer
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
```

## Development Guidelines

- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Prefer small, testable commits.
- Update documentation when behavior changes.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same pull request.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code changes are scoped to one clear purpose
- [ ] Relevant docs were updated (`README.md`, commands, or examples)
- [ ] Local checks pass for the modified area
- [ ] PR description explains the problem, solution, and impact

## Maintainer Release Process

To keep Open Source releases consistent and easy to manage, this project uses **SemVer tags** in the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version.
2. Bump version metadata in:
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`plugins[0].version`)
3. Keep GitHub metadata up to date (when positioning changes):
   - `.github/settings.yml` (repository description + topics)
   - `.github/release-intro.md` (release intro + hashtags)
4. Merge to `main`.
5. Create and push an annotated release tag:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

6. The publish workflow will automatically:
   - validate tag/version consistency,
   - build artifacts,
   - publish to PyPI,
   - create a GitHub Release with generated notes.

## Reporting Issues

When filing an issue, include:

- What you expected
- What happened instead
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details (OS, Python version, command used)
- Relevant logs or screenshots (if available)

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all discussions and reviews.
